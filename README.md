# docs and code

Let's start this!

This makes it so that I can clone this docs repository to have all snippets of code inside a VM.

With this I can go into the VM and, with&#x20;

`$ git clone https://github.com/djismgaming/docs`&#x20;

get all scripts/code snippets needed for setting up any of these apps/services/configurations.
