# Docs and code

Let's start this!

This makes it so that I can clone this docs repository to have all snippets of code inside a VM.

I use unRAID and noVNC does not have a working copy/paste implementation to the VM manager inside unRAID.&#x20;

With this I can go into the VM and, with&#x20;

`$ git clone https://github.com/djismgaming/docs`&#x20;

get all scripts/code snippets needed for setting up any of these apps/services.
